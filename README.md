Chrome extension to hide banner ads on the Economist's webpage

On economist.com, it is possible to get around the paywall by disactivating javascript in chrome. However there is an annoyingly large banner ad at the top of the page, which makes it difficult to read the articles.

This is a chrome extension to hide the banner ad.
